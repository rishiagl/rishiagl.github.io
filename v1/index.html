        <p>I'm a software programmer/developer based in India and currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata, India. My passing year is 2024. I specialize in computer programming using Modern C/C++ and have a fair share of knowledge about other programming languages such as Java, Python, and Golang. I also have experience in markup languages such as HTML, CSS, Markdown, and LaTex, whose living example is this website created using HTML and CSS. My Academic curriculum involved Data structures and algorithms, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Database Management Systems, Compiler Design, and Machine Learning. I tried my best to understand and excel in these subjects.</p>
        <p>I actively take part in competitive programming on platforms like Leetcode, Google Kickstart, and Hackerrank. I have developed and hosted projects on Android development and Backend Infrastructure of small Web Applications. I enjoy playing chess in my spare time, and during extended vacations, I always go on exciting adventures. I am a minimalist at heart, therefore I tried to keep this site as basic as possible; I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
